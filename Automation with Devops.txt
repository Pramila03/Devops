1. Selenium (Automation Testing - Core Skill)
Goal: Learn to automate browser tasks using Selenium WebDriver.
Best Way to Learn:
Understand Basics of Testing:
Learn about manual vs automation testing.
Understand test cases, test suites, bugs, etc.
Pick a Programming Language:
Start with Java or Python (most used with Selenium).
Learn OOP concepts, functions, loops, exception handling.
Learn Selenium WebDriver:
Basics: Launch browser, find elements, click, input text.
Advanced: Waits (implicit/explicit), handling pop-ups, frames, dropdowns.
Page Object Model (POM): Structure your test code efficiently.

Practice Projects:
Automate login pages, search flows, form submissions.
Use test sites like https://the-internet.herokuapp.com.
Learn Test Frameworks:
Java: TestNG / JUnit
Python: PyTest / Unittest
Learn assertions, test reports, parameterization.
ðŸ”¹ 2. CI/CD - Jenkins (DevOps Integration)
Goal: Automate test execution and deployment process.
Best Way to Learn:
Understand CI/CD Concepts:
Continuous Integration: Code merge & testing.
Continuous Delivery: Automated deployment.
Install Jenkins Locally (or use Docker):
Learn Jenkins architecture, pipelines, plugins.
Create Jobs:
Freestyle project: Trigger Selenium scripts.
Pipeline (Groovy syntax): Build -> Test -> Report.
Integrate with Git & Test Framework:
Clone from GitHub/Bitbucket.
Run tests & publish reports in Jenkins.
Automate with Webhooks:
Auto-trigger builds when code is pushed.
. Bitbucket / GitHub (Version Control)
Goal: Manage and collaborate on code efficiently.
Best Way to Learn:
Understand Git Basics:
git init, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge.
Learn using CLI, then GUI (SourceTree or VS Code extensions).
Host Repos on GitHub/Bitbucket:
Create, clone, fork repos.
Collaborate using pull requests, code reviews.
Use in Real Projects:
Track test scripts in Git.
Connect repo to Jenkins for automated builds.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Agile Methodology (Jira)
Goal: Understand Agile project management & test planning.
Best Way to Learn:
Learn Agile Basics:
Scrum framework: roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master), sprints, stand-ups, retros.
Jira for Testers:
Create user stories, bugs, tasks.
Update sprint boards.
Link issues with test cases.
Use Jira in Practice:
Join sample projects or use Jira trial.
